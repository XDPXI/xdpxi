        <h2>1. Data Backup and Responsibility</h2>
        <p>
            While we take reasonable measures to ensure data integrity,
            <b>we are not responsible for backups of your server data</b>. It is your
            sole responsibility to maintain local backups of any important files,
            configurations, and game data. We strongly recommend implementing a
            regular backup schedule to protect against data loss. We are not liable
            for any data loss incurred as a result of server deletion, hardware
            failure, software bugs, user error, or other unforeseen circumstances.

        <h2>2. Resource Usage and Fair Use</h2>
        <p>
            Server resources (CPU, RAM, bandwidth) are allocated based on usage and

            ensure fair usage and optimal performance for all users.
        </p>

            <b>Abuse of resources is strictly prohibited</b>. Examples of abuse
            include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Running resource-intensive processes unrelated to your service (e.g.,

            Violations may result in throttling, suspension, or termination of your

            resource abuse at our sole and absolute discretion.

        <p>
            You are responsible for maintaining the security of your server and

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using strong, unique passwords.</li>
            <li>Enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) where available.</li>

        <p>
            We are not responsible for <b>compromised accounts or data breaches</b>
            resulting from your failure to implement adequate security measures. You
            are liable for all consequences resulting from unauthorized access to your
            server. Please report any suspected security breaches to us immediately.

        <p>
            Excessive bandwidth usage that negatively impacts the network performance

            usage and implement restrictions or additional charges if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples of excessive bandwidth usage include, but are not limited to:

            <li>Running file-sharing services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If your server consistently exceeds reasonable bandwidth limits, as
            determined by our monitoring, we will contact you to discuss options for
            reducing usage or upgrading your service plan. Failure to comply may
            result in service suspension.

        <h2>5. Server Downgrade Policy</h2>
        <p>
            To optimize resource allocation and provide cost-effective services,
            servers with consistently low player counts may be downgraded to a
            lower-end server configuration. We will evaluate server usage
            periodically.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have the option to maintain your current server configuration by
            contacting us and paying the difference in cost. If you choose not to pay
            the difference, your server will be downgraded.

            materially affect their services, such as changes to the server deletion
            policy or resource allocation. We will attempt to provide reasonable
            advance notice, but are not required to do so. Notification will
            typically be provided via email to the server owner's registered email
            address and/or through announcements on our website or control panel. It
            is your responsibility to review this policy periodically for updates.

        <p>The following policy applies specifically to XD's Minecraft Servers, in
            addition to the general policy above. In case of conflict, this Minecraft
            policy takes precedence for Minecraft servers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="section-1-mc">
        <h2>1. Server Inactivity and Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            To ensure efficient resource management, servers exhibiting inactivity
            will be subject to the following policy:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Freezing:</b> Servers will be automatically frozen after
                <b>7 consecutive days of inactivity</b>. Inactivity is defined as no
                active players and no administrative access or modifications to the
                server.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Deletion:</b> Frozen servers will be permanently deleted after an
                additional <b>14 consecutive days of inactivity</b>. A warning
                notification will be sent to the server owner's registered email
                address and/or discord account <b>3 days</b> prior to deletion.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It is your responsibility to maintain server activity to avoid automatic
            removal. Regular logins, player activity, or administrative changes will
            prevent your server from being classified as inactive. The notification
            is a courtesy; failure to receive the notification for any reason does
            not prevent the server from being deleted according to this policy.
